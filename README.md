(design cipher and show link) In the last decade humanity experienced a radical change, foremost it became entirely computerized. Every part of the society – individuals, citizens, businesses, organisations – are in a constant touch with technology that makes our lives and work easier. ICT has completely penetrated the society and because of that we believe there is a need for a museum institution that will document and reflect these changes in society, and foster a holistic public discourse on new technologies.

Through our collection, at the moment consisting of more than 6500 examples of hardware and software, books, magazines and related objects representing the history of computing development in Slovenia and abroad and with the help of interlaced programs, we aim to provide a means of understanding of the high level of informatization in our society while at the same time we encourage individuals to become engaged, aware and conscious co-creators of our digital society.

We see our strengths in industry wide and inter-generational synergies, ability to bring together the technological past, present and vision of the future, and in a clearly stated attention for interactive content. Our goal is to present a truly multimedia museum experience and contemporary participatory museum practice, in which the visitor becomes an active, emancipated party.
